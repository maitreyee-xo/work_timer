# ABOUT THE PROJECT

The uploaded .py file contains code to a tkinter based application which, by using time management method, helps the user to track their productivity with a minimal and simplistic GUI. It breaks work into intervals and allows the user to have a fixed target time of 25 minutes followed by a short break of 5 minutes. This cycle is repeated thrice until it allows the user to take a long break of 20 minutes after three reps. The check mark in the lower area of the screen makes the user experience better by keeping a count of the number of reps they have completed.
If the user wishes to reset their progress, the same can be done by simply tapping on the 'reset' button, which restores the data and erases all the past progress.
